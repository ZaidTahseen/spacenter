<h1>How to buy a membership?</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">To buy a membership, contact the front desk, you will need to fill in a form, which includes your name, surname, email, phone number, and the amount you will pay to buy a membership. You either get membership cards or you get tokens, you can choose that in your form.Within 1 week you will need to collect your card or token from the front desk. Enjoy your membership.</p>
<br>

<h1>How to use a membership card/token?</h1>
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">Use a membership card or token for therapies and upcoming events by Esmeralda. As per the money vaule you choose to keep in your card/token, you'll be able to pay for all events and therapies. If you choose a 'Royal Massage' you may pay by your card/token. When events like; 'Foot Spa Events', 'Grounding Revive Events', or many more come up you can pay through your cards/token. Your membership will last for 2 months respectively.</p>
<br>
<h1>What if the card/token has no value left?</h1>
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">If the card/token has no value left in it, you can't be able to pay through it, in proper words your membership had ended. You will need to pay by cash, or take a new membership again. Sometimes, you can double up the membership and last your card/token more than 2 months, by this you'll need to pay more cash to the front desk to get membership more than 2 months.</p>
<br>
<h1>How to last membership for more than 2 months?</h1>
<p  style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">For lasting your membership more than 2 months, you will need to contact the manager, Samaira Noronha. Phone details and all will be given while you take your first therapy. The manager will explain to you that, for 2 months you have to choose between '2,000', '6,000', '10,000' & '15,000' & you chose '10,000' then this cash or value will be given to you in a format of card or a token, you'll be able to use it up for 2 months, but if you want for 4, 6, or 8 months you'll need to double the payment amount, like 10,000 + 10,000 which gives you 20,000- so this is the value you will need to pay and you get a membership for 4 months. This same method can be used if you want to buy a membership for 6-8 months or 1 year.</p>
